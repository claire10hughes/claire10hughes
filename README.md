# **Dataset that I think is neat** #

[Allen Institute Brain Map ](https://portal.brain-map.org/)

This database provides a wealth of knowledge of the different areas of the brain and their functions down to a molecular level. 

#  Why I like It  #
One of the departments that I support in my job is Neuroscience - so I have seen the good work being done by Neuroscientists

My mother's life was saved by a Neurosurgeon, and I will be eternally grateful

# **Topic/Respository I Found** #

Inspired by my constant need for free time and the always being on the presipice of burn-out, I found this great repository that has a plethora of resources all about mental health - [awesome-mental-health](https://github.com/dreamingechoes/awesome-mental-health)
